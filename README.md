# Lost Ark Material Helper

The Lost Ark Material Helper is a tool for figuring out how many materials a character or your entire roster generates on a daily basis, and use that information to estimate
how long it might take to achieve goals within the game. Below are some important aspects of the app that will help you make use of it.

## Assumptions

* It is impossible to consider every source of materials for a given user, so only Chaos Dungeons and Guardians are considered in the app.
  * This means that in a real world application, goals will often be met on a shorter timeline than provided by this app.
* Because of the first assumption, the app will primarily be used as an estimation tool.
* Each character entered into this app is running the highest content it can access.
  * After basic functionality is finished, a "Yoho Fan" and "Deskaluda Fan" option may be included for people who skip Velganos and Kungelanium.
* Characters entered run content on a daily basis, or in the case of rested characters, this bonus is used consistently.
* T1 and T2 go by quickly after the global honing changes were applied, and as such, do not need consideration.
* Gold, fusion materials, and silver are handled by the player.
